    Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced relatively high population growth, which raises concerns about the potential contribution of large young cohorts, termed ‘youth bulges’, to unrest. 
    Youth bulges, under the right circumstances, can expand productivity and boost economic growth, but they have also been found to enable civil war, corruption, and democracy collapse, 
    especially where resources are scarce. This paper considers youth bulges characterised by high proportions of rural–urban migrants and examines their effects on the likelihood of social 
    conflict in urban sub- Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2013. METHODS United Nations data on urban and rural populations by age and sex is combined with the Social Conflict Analysis Database 
    to create a cross-section time series dataset. Negative binomial models are used to examine the relationship between youth bulges and conflict using country level fixed effects. The study finds 
    that a migrant-based youth bulge does not increase the likelihood of urban social conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, female youth bulges, often neglected when studying conflict, are 
    found to increase the likelihood of conflict. The overall disassociation between young rural–urban migrants and social conflict is encouraging. All the same, women were found to play a role in 
    conflict, and women should therefore be considered in future studies. This article characterises the composition of youth bulges – an important factor that has previously been ignored – by examining 
    whether youth bulges composed largely of rural–urban migrants are more likely to increase the likelihood of conflict in urban sub-Saharan Africa.

    Across the world, populations have transitioned to inhabiting urban spaces, and in low- and middle-income countries the proportion of people living in cities is expected to continue to increase. Anticipation of this fundamental process 
    calls for a better understanding of the demographic factors that drive the urban transition. By indirectly estimating the joint contribution of migration and administrative reclassification to urban transition in 129 countries 
    using urban and rural population by age and sex data available from the United Nations over 1985–2015, we find that differences in natural increase between the rural and urban sectors explain most of the urbanization over the 30-year 
    period examined. Over the urban transition, the role of migration and reclassification declines and becomes negligible. Despite data limitations, we confirm that it is misleading to view migration as fueling urbanization in low- and middle-income countries.

    The components of urbanisation are important to understand, since urbanisation is closely related to development. Internal migration was key in historical urban transitions, while in contemporary transitions the balance of births 
    and deaths has been the main driver of urbanisation. Reclassification of rural areas and international migration also contribute to urbanisation.
    Objective: Unlike previous work based on indirectly measured net migration estimates, we directly estimate in- and out-migration rates between rural and urban areas across Africa and Asia by age and sex, and 
    evaluate the contribution of the balance of these flows to urbanisation. We use 67 census samples from IPUMS International for 28 countries in Africa and Asia between 1970 and 2014 to estimate in- and out- migration 
    between rural and urban areas, based on available questions of residence. We then model age- and sex-specific migration rates using Poisson regression and estimate net migration through marginal effects.
    Results confirm that, in both continents, urbanisation is not generated by rural-to-urban migration but by the urban population itself, be it through natural growth or through expansion to peripheral areas. 
    In Asia, urbanisation reflects internal migration trends and reclassification decisions to a greater extent than in Africa, where natural growth is the key contributor.
    In Asia, urbanisation reflects internal migration trends and reclassification decisions to a greater extent than in Africa where natural growth is the key contributor.
    By using direct estimates, we ascertain the role of inter-regional rural–urban migration in urbanisation. We find that a positive effect of inter-regional migration is counter-balanced by a negative effect of intra-regional 
    migration (combined with reclassification and international migration).

    Urbanization involves a shift of populations from one area to another, and is associated with changing social and economic structures. 
    Here, we use the term “urbanization” to refer to the difference between urban and rural rates of growth (a differential rate of growth). 
    In contrast, we refer to the proportion of people living in the urban sector, and its change over time as the “proportion or percent urban”.

    of this fundamental process calls for better understanding of the demographic factors that drive the urban
    transition. By indirectly estimating the joint contribution of migration and reclassification to urban

    migration-reclassification declines and is negligible by 2015. Despite data limitations, we confirm that it is
    misleading to view migration as fuelling urbanisation in low- and middle-income countries.
