    Assessing the impact of government responses to Covid-19 is crucial to contain the pandemic and improve preparedness for future crises. We investigate here the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 
    and infection threats on the daily evolution of cross-border movements of people during the Covid-19 pandemic. We use a unique database on Facebook usersâ€™ mobility, and rely on regression and machine learning 
    models to identify the role of infection threats and containment policies. Permutation techniques allow us to compare the impact and predictive power of these two categories of variables.

    The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has given rise to new packages of interventions. Among them, international travel restrictions have been one of the fastest and most visible responses to limit the spread of the virus and its variants. 
    While inducing large economic losses, the epidemiological consequences of such travel restrictions are highly uncertain. They may be poorly effective when a new transmissible virus already circulates across borders. 
    Assessing the effectiveness of travel restrictions is difficult given the paucity of data on daily cross-border mobility and on existing virus circulation. 
    The question was topical and timely when the omicron variant  -- classified as a variant of concern by WHO --  was detected and perceived as more contagious. 
    In this study, we develop a multi-country compartmental model of the SIR type. We use it to simulate the spread of a new virus across European countries, and to assess the effectiveness of unilateral and 
    multilateral travel restrictions.
