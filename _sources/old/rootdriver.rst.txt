    This paper sheds light on the global migration patterns of the past 40 years, and produces migration projections for the 21st century. 
    To do this, we build a simple model of the world economy, and we parameterize it to match the economic and socio-demographic characteristics of the world in the year 2010. 
    We conduct backcasting and nowcasting exercises, which demonstrate that our model fits very well the past and ongoing trends in international migration, and that historical trends were mostly governed by demographic changes. 
    Then, we describe a set of migration projections for the 21st century. In line with the backcasts, our world migration prospects are mainly governed by socio-demographic changes. 
    Using immigration restrictions or development policies to curb these pressures requires sealing borders or triggering unprecedented economic takeoffs in migrants’ countries of origin. 
    Increasing migration is thus a likely phenomenon for the 21st century.

    In this paper I develop a stylized model of the world economy and use it to explain the long-run trends in international migration. 
    The model very well fits the trends of the last 40 years which are mainly governed by the evolution of population disparities between industrialized and developing countries. 
    Then I provide migration projections for the 21st century and show that future migration is also governed by socio-demographic changes. 
    I predict a robust increase in immigration pressures from sub-Saharan Africa and MENA countries to European countries.

**International migration is a selective process as the propensity to emigrate increases with education. Selection decreases with development, but the brain drain often turns into a brain gain in the poorest countries of the world.**

  .. dropdown:: Docquier, F. & S. Veljanoska (2020).  *Is emigration harmful to those left behind?* **Annual Reviews of Resource Economics**, 12, 367-388. 
    
    From the perspective of sending countries, international migrants are positively selected in terms of schooling, particularly in low-income countries. 
    While emigration affects human capital accumulation, it also induces positive spin-offs in the form of remittances, incentives to acquire education, and diffusion of technology and democratic ideas. 
    The net income implications for those left behind are uncertain. This article reviews the main transmission channels investigated in the existing literature and uses a standard development accounting framework to 
    provide estimates of their relative strength and of their combined effect. Although skill biased, emigration increases the disposable income of those left behind in no fewer than three-quarters of the 
    countries of the world. This result is robust to variations in the set of parameter values within a reasonable spectrum established in the empirical literature.

    Due to self-selection and skill-selective immigration policies, highly educated individuals exhibit much greater propensity to emigrate internationally than the less educated. 
    Although skill-biased emigration has long been viewed as detrimental to the growth potential of the sending country, recent studies emphasize the fact that it also induces economic benefits. 
    This chapter reviews the existing literature on brain drain and development, documents global selection patterns, and provides updated estimates of the (net) effect of skill-biased emigration on human 
    capital formation, human capital accumulation, and macroeconomic performance for almost every country in the world. The quantitative analysis suggests that skill-biased emigration can be beneficial for 
    human development and economic growth in most countries at the bottom of the income distribution as well as in some middle-income countries.

    International migration is a selective process that induces ambiguous effects on human capital and economic development in the countries of origin, global inequality and extreme poverty. 
    To quantify these effects, we propose a generalized approach that establishes the micro-foundations of the relationship between selective emigration and human capital accumulation in a multi-country context, 
    and embeds this migration-education nexus into a development accounting framework. We find that selective emigration stimulates human capital accumulation and the income of those remaining behind in a majority 
    of countries, in particular in the least developed ones. The magnitude of the effect varies according to the level of development, the dyadic structure of migration costs, and the education policy. 
    Emigration significantly reduces cross-country disparities in income per capita, as well as the proportion of extreme poor in the world population.

**The brain gain mechanisms holds true in the medical sector.**

  .. dropdown:: Adovor, E. & M. Czaika & F. Docquier & Y. Moullan (2021). *Medical brain drain: how many, where and why?* **Journal of Health Economics**, 76, 102409. 
    
    We build a new database documenting the evolution of physician migration over a period of 25 years (1990–2014), and use it to empirically shed light on its determinants. 
    In relative terms, the highest emigration rates are observed in small island nations and low-income countries, where needs-based deficits of healthcare workers are often estimated to be most severe. 
    Over time, we identify rising trends in Caribbean islands, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. On the contrary, despite increasing migration flows to Western Europe, physician migration rates from sub-Saharan 
    Africa have been stable or even decreasing. Our empirical analysis reveals that physician migration is a complex phenomenon that results from a myriad of push, pull, and dyadic factors. 
    It is strongly affected by the economic characteristics of origin and destination countries. The sensitivity to these push and pull factors is governed by linguistic and geographic ties between countries. 
    Interestingly, we find that the evolution of medical brain drain is affected by immigration policies aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. In particular, physician migration is sensitive to visa restrictions, 
    diploma recognition, points-based system, tax breaks towards migrants, and the option of obtaining a permanent resident status.

    We exploit a new dataset on physicians' emigration and medical training to investigate whether reversing or stopping physician brain drain could help reduce shortages of medical doctors and improve access to 
    medical services in sending countries. Using dynamic panel regressions, and combining internal and external instruments, we find evidence of a positive effect of emigration prospects on medical training. 
    The short-run effect is small, implying that a marginal increase in emigration exacerbates shortages of physicians practicing in most countries within a period of 5 years. The long-run elasticity is larger, 
    however, implying that increasing emigration gradually spurs the long-run stock of physicians practicing at the sending country when emigration rate remains below 15%. Contrary to popular wisdom, 
    we find that policies aiming to reverse or stop the emigration of physicians might reduce their worldwide stock and aggravate their shortage in about 80% of countries.

**A net brain gain requires good international connectivity and access to education. In poor countries, the brain gain benefits the richest regions only. Isolated regions with poor education infrastructure incur human capital losses.**

  .. dropdown:: Bocquier, P. & N. Cha’gnom & F. Docquier & J. Machado (2023). *The Within-Country Distribution of Brain Drain and Brain Gain Effects: A Case Study on Senegal.* 

    Existing empirical literature provides converging evidence that selective emigration boosts human capital accumulation in the world’s poorest countries. 
    However, the within-country distribution of such brain gain effects has been largely disregarded. Focusing on Senegal, we provide evidence that the brain gain mechanism benefits the richest regions that are 
    internationally connected and have better access to education. Human capital responses are negligible in regions lacking international connectivity, and even negative in better connected regions with poor 
    access to education. These results also pertain to internal migration, suggesting that highly vulnerable populations are trapped in the least developed areas. Designing policies to improve connectivity and 
    access to education is of prime importance to combat extreme poverty and realize the 2030 Agenda's principle of leaving-no-one-behind.

**Extreme weather shocks have ambiguous effects on people mobility. It is empirically challenging to identify robust and general climate migration patterns from the past decades.**

  .. dropdown:: Aoga, J. & J. Bae & S. Veljanoska & S. Nijssen, P. Schaus (2020). *Impact of weather factors on migration intention using machine learning algorithms.* 
    
    A growing attention in the empirical literature has been paid to the incidence of climate shocks and change in migration decisions. Previous literature leads to different results and uses a multitude of 
    traditional empirical approaches. This paper proposes a tree-based Machine Learning (ML) approach to analyze the role of the weather shocks towards an individual's intention to migrate in the six 
    agriculture-dependent-economy countries such as Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. We perform several tree-based algorithms (e.g., XGB, Random Forest) using the 
    train-validation-test workflow to build robust and noise-resistant approaches. Then we determine the important features showing in which direction they are influencing the migration intention. 
    This ML-based estimation accounts for features such as weather shocks captured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for different timescales and various socioeconomic 
    features/covariates. We find that (i) weather features improve the prediction performance although socioeconomic characteristics have more influence on migration intentions, 
    (ii) country-specific model is necessary, and (iii) international move is influenced more by the longer timescales of SPEIs while general move (which includes internal move) by that of shorter timescales.

    We use a multilevel approach to investigate whether a general and robust relationship between weather shocks and (internal and international) migration intentions can be uncovered in Western African countries. 
    We combine individual survey data with measures of localized weather shocks for 13 countries over the 2008–2016 period. A meta-analysis on results from about 51,000 regressions is conducted to identify the 
    specification of weather anomalies that maximizes the goodness of fit of our empirical model. We then use this best specification to document heterogeneous mobility responses to weather shocks. We find that 
    variability in Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index/rainfall is associated with changing intentions to move locally or internationally in a few countries only. However, the significance, 
    sign and magnitude of the effect are far from being robust and consistent across countries. These differences might be due to imperfections in the data or to differences in long-term climate conditions and 
    adaptation capabilities. They may also suggest that credit constraints are internalized differently in different settings, or that moving internally is not a relevant option as weather conditions are spatially 
    correlated while moving abroad is an option of last resort. Although our multilevel approach allows us to connect migration intentions with the timing and spatial dimension of weather shocks, identifying a 
    common specification that governs weather-driven mobility decisions is a very difficult, if not impossible, task, even for countries belonging to the same region. Our findings also call for extreme caution 
    before generalizing results from specific case studies.

    We examine the impact of climate anomalies on migration patterns in Senegal, where millions of individuals rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. 
    Utilizing comprehensive data from the 2013 Senegalese census, which includes 13 million individuals, and incorporating novel data on fine-grained drought measures, 
    we assess mobility responses to climate variability. We show that the aggregate agricultural output is particularly dependent on rainfall in Senegal. 
    Estimating a gravity model of medium-run internal migration flows over two 5-year migration episodes between 426 localities, we show that the exposure to droughts was caused lower migration rates at 
    rural origin localities. On the other side, exceptionally wet growing seasons were linked to higher migration rates. The results suggest the presence of severe financial constraints limiting 
    the potential of costly migratory moves for those depending on income from agricultural activities. Our findings challenge the prevailing climate-migration narrative and calls for special consideration of 
    the needs for those left behind.

    How do weather shocks influence human mobility and poverty, and how will long-term climate change affect future migration over the course of the 21st century? 
    These questions have gained unprecedented attention in public debates as global warming is already having severe impacts around the world, and prospects for the coming decades get worse. 
    Low-latitude countries in general, and their agricultural areas in particular, have contributed the least to climate change but are the most adversely affected. 
    The effect on people's voluntary and forced displacements is of major concern for both developed and developing countries. On 18 October 2019, Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and 
    Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER) organized a workshop on Climate Migration with the aim of uncovering the mechanisms through which fast-onset variables 
    (such as weather anomalies, storms, hurricanes, torrential rains, floods, landslides, etc.) and slow-onset variables (such as temperature trends, desertification, rising sea level, coastal erosion, etc.) 
    influence both people's incentives to move and mobility constraints. This special issue gathers five papers prepared for this workshop, which shed light on (or predict) the effect of extreme weather shocks and 
    long-term climate change on human mobility, and stress the implications for the development community.

    We study how the slow deterioration of soil, caused by climate change, affects internal migration and household resettlement. Rural households are expected to move when they face worsening soil conditions, 
    as soil degradation is detrimental to agricultural productivity. The other possibility is that they can get stuck in a poverty trap. We use the Integrated Household Survey in Malawi for the years 2010-2016. 
    Soil depletion is not a random process and to account for its endogeneity, we instrument soil degradation by using distant climate shocks and controlling for recent weather conditions. 
    We find that severe soil nutrient constraints push households to send their members away. The underlying mechanism is that soil degradation is harmful to agricultural productivity, and therefore food security, 
    which incentivizes households to seek better opportunities by pushing their members to migrate.
