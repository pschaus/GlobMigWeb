**Future education policies and international mobility frictions will impact income convergence vs. divergence. Without drastic changes, international migration policies and laws will have limited effects on global inequality.**

    This paper analyzes the factors underlying the evolution of the worldwide distribution of skills and their implications for global inequality. We develop and parameterize a two-sector, two-class, 
    world economy model that endogenizes education and mobility decisions, population growth, and income disparities across and within countries. First, our static experiments reveal that the geography 
    of skills matters for global inequality. Low access to education and sectoral misallocation of skills substantially influence income in poor countries. Second, we produce unified projections of population 
    and income for the 21st century. Assuming the continuation of recent education and migration policies, we predict stable disparities in the world distribution of skills, slow-growing urbanization in developing 
    countries, and a rebound in income inequality. These prospects are sensitive to future education costs and to internal mobility frictions, which suggests that policies targeting access to all levels of 
    education and sustainable urban development have a long-term impact on demographic growth and global inequality.

**Relaxing international migration restrictions slightly may exacerbate the poverty responses to climate change if decision-makers are unable to screen individuals in extreme poverty. Strengthening restrictions has limited effect on poverty.**

    This paper investigates the long-term implications of climate change on global migration and inequality. Accounting for the effects of changing temperatures, sea levels, and the frequency and intensity of 
    natural disasters, we model the impact of climate change on productivity and utility in a dynamic general equilibrium framework. 
    By endogenizing people’s migration decisions across millions of 5×5 km spatial cells, our approach sheds light on the magnitude and dyadic, education-specific structure of human migration induced by global 
    warming. We find that climate change strongly intensifies global inequality and poverty, reinforces urbanization, and boosts migration from low- to high-latitude areas. 
    Median projections suggest that climate change will induce a voluntary and a forced permanent relocation of 62 million working-age individuals over the course of the 21st century. 
    Overall, under current international migration laws and policies, only a small fraction of people suffering from the negative effects of climate change manages to move beyond their homelands. 
    We conclude that it is unlikely that climate shocks will induce massive international flows of migrants, except under combined extremely pessimistic climate scenarios and highly permissive migration policies. 
    In contrast, poverty resulting from climate change is a real threat to all of us.
