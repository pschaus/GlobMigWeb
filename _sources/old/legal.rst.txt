    The GCM’s potential depends on recent developments in the material and institutional frameworks of the European Union which have been deeply influenced by the migration crises. 
    The paper examines the tensions between human rights and State sovereignty through relevant case law from the European Courts of Luxembourg and Strasbourg (1); 
    light is shed on new migration governance methods, such as policies and non-legal instruments deployed by the EU and its Member States, as opposed to traditional law making (2); 
    the interplay between unilateral, bilateral and multilateral cooperation in migration matters is addressed (3).

**Soft law in EU cooperation on migration has practical consequences in the EU legal framework.**

  .. dropdown:: Frasca, E. (2021). *More or Less (Soft) Law? The case of third country migration cooperation and the long-term effects of EU preference for soft law instruments*. **Queen Mary Law Journal**, vol. 1, 1-32. 
 
    Through a variety of examples, an appraisal of EU third-country informal cooperation on migration is provided to show that a preference towards softer instruments of cooperation has emerged. 
    To illustrate the breadth and depth of such informal tools, four perspectives are adopted: first, a geographical one, which elucidates the reach of the EU action; second, 
    a perspective related to the vastness and variety of the objectives pursued through informal cooperation; third, one which focuses on the role of funding in support of this action; and lastly, 
    a perspective which examines the narrative framework of soft cooperation. This paper aims to assess whether and to what extent this trend reflects either a ‘more’ or ‘less’ law approach to third country 
    migration cooperation in the EU. Through the lens of European soft law theory, the status of informal cooperation within the realm of soft law is examined. As the choice of ‘more’ or ‘less’ law is inherently 
    political, the preference for alternative law-making methods can have an immense impact on the functioning of a legal system. 
    Thus, some of the practical consequences produced by soft law in this field are presented, namely de-proceduralisation, de-formalisation and de-legalisation.

**Many challenges hinders the States of the African Great Lakes region to establish a migration management cooperation both among themselves and with the EU.**

  .. dropdown:: Sarolea, S. & A. M. Ombeni (2022). *Migration: The African Great Lakes and the European Union*, in **Worlds Apart: African and European Perspectives on Migration**, Akinola, A. O. & J. Bjarnesen (Manchester University Press), 239-260. 
 
    This chapter examines migration to and from the African Great Lakes (AGL) region. The geographical and historical delineation of this region is unclear and the overlap of cooperation bodies under the name ‘Great Lakes’ leads to confusion. 
    The chapter seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the AGL’s migration context, the state of cooperation and migration law in the subregion, before exploring its cooperation with the EU on migration, and discussing the prospects 
    for cooperation offered by the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).

**The truly “common vision” in the AU-EU partnership may only take shape if sustained by commitments and effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms.**

    The recent, critical developments occurred after the Russian invasion of Ukraine have triggered serious repercussions on the whole international, economic and geo-political order. The effects seem especially impactful for the European and African regions, 
    with a number of potential, major consequences in humanitarian-migratory terms, as well as in crucial sectors such as energy, trade, food and agriculture. In this scenario, the Euro-African cooperation plays a pivotal role. 
    This contribution intends to focus on whether and to what extent the cooperation between the European and the African Unions may lead to a common, timely and effective response to current challenges such as agri-food security, climate change and migration. 
    It is divided into three main parts: the first is devoted to a general overview of the Africa-EU relations, and their different shapes and methodologies; the second focuses specifically on the bi-regional cooperation between the African Union and the European Union, 
    exploring its origin, subsequent evolution, as well as its legal- institutional settings; finally, the third part addresses the most recent initiatives put in place by the two international organizations with regard to issues such as food security, agriculture, climate change and environment.

**The AU-EU-UN trilateral cooperation may be a positive step in addressing  the  Libyan  crisis, but it needs to focus on structural problems rather than on emergencies.**

  .. dropdown:: Gatta, F.L. (2019). *The trilateral cooperation between the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations on migration and Libya: a successful example of collaboration?*, **Federalismi**, Focus Africa n. 3, ISSN 1826 3534. 
 
    This article explores the operational responses put in place by the EU, alone and in cooperation  with  other  international  actors,  in  order  to  cope  with  the  humanitarian  and  migration  crises generated by the situation in Libya. 
    Following a brief reconstruction of the background of the Libyan crisis, the focus is put on the EU’s operational interventions in Libya,  with  the  analysis,  in  particular,  of  the  operations  EUBAM  Libya  and  EUNAVFOR  MED  “Operation Sophia”. 
    The multilateral response to the Libyan crisis put in place at the international level is  then  addressed,  focusing  on  the  collaboration  between  the  EU,  the  United  Nations and the African Union, with particular regard to the Joint Trilateral 
    Task force on migration and Libya established at the end of 2017. After analysing the concrete initiatives put in place by the AU-EU-UN Task Force to protect and evacuate migrants from Libyan detention centres, thearticle concludes by proposing an 
    overall assessment of the trilateral cooperation between these international organisations.

**The so-called ‘migration’ or ‘refugee crisis’ and the crisis of the principle of the rule of law are interrelated.**

  .. dropdown:: Gatta, F.L. (2019). *Migration and Rule of (human rights) Law: Two ‘crises’ looking in the same mirror*, in **Croatian Yearbook of European Law and Policy**, vol. 15, 99-133. 
 
    This article will attempt to demonstrate the interrelationship between two ‘crises’ that the European Union is facing; the so-called ‘migration’ or ‘refugee crisis’ and the crisis of the 
    principle of the rule of law. In particular, the two crises find their point of connection in the responses to migratory flows put in place by the EU and some of its Member States. 
    The increasing migratory pressure on European external borders has induced some governments to adopt a restrictive and security-driven approach, carried out, on the one hand, by 
    reinforcing border controls and surveillance, and, on the other, by seeking the cooperation of non-EU countries in order to curb migratory flows, contain departures, and tackle the 
    movements of migrants towards Europe. These ‘securitisation’ and ‘externalisation’ strategies are in contrast with the principle of the rule of law under two perspectives: on the one hand, 
    they violate some of its essential components, such as transparency, legal and procedural certainty, democratic participation, and control; on the other, they breach the same principle insofar 
    as they lead to severe human rights violations. As for the first aspect, migration and border control policies have been put in place by frontline States through a growing proliferation of atypical, 
    informal, and non-transparent measures of migration governance, which, sounding ‘legal’ without actually being so, allow legislative, procedural and democratic frames to be avoided. Examples in this 
    sense may be identified in the so-called EU-Turkey Statement or in the informal, over-simplified cooperation arrangements concluded by some EU frontline Member States with African countries, as in 
    the case of Italy and Niger. As for the second aspect, the impact on the rule of (human rights) law of the response of some EU Member States to the migration crisis may be measured through the case 
    law of the European Court of Human Rights and, more specifically, by considering the decisions concerning the most severe violations of migrants’ rights, including those of the prohibitions of 
    refoulement and of collective expulsion, as well as cases of illegal detention and deprivation of liberty.

**The Belgian legislation entrusts criminal judges with the control of the legality of the detention of third-country nationals has several pitfalls.**

    This chapter illustrates the poor quality of the current legal regime regulating detention of third-country nationals in Belgium, due to the combined procedure and delimitation of judicial competences which are 
    not interlinked or communicating. It also implies a blurring between third-country nationals and criminal offenders, problematic in two respects. First, the risk of conflict between the decisions of the 
    criminal judge and those of the administrative judge is high, and such conflict undermines the transparency and coherence of the system. Second, in most situations both administrative review and judicial 
    review have non-suspensive effect and suffer from a lack of effectiveness.
