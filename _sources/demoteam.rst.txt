----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wanli Nie joined the GLOBMIG project since July 2020 under the supervision of Philippe Bocquier. 
In 2021, she prepared the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimate of migration rates for 70 censuses in 30 countries in Asia and Africa, in both “UR” (urban-rural) and “COR” (capital-other urban-rural) approaches. 
Together with her promoter Professor Philippe Bocquier and Dr. Ashira Menashe-Oren, they encountered many practical issues during the estimation process as missing values, 
lack of consistency between censuses, identification of migrants, etc., but they were able to come up with acceptable solutions during the meetings. 
She presented their paper with preliminary results on the International Population Conference 2021 (online).
