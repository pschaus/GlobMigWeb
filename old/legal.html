<p class="card-text">Through a variety of examples, an appraisal of EU third-country informal cooperation on migration is provided to show that a preference towards softer instruments of cooperation has emerged.
To illustrate the breadth and depth of such informal tools, four perspectives are adopted: first, a geographical one, which elucidates the reach of the EU action; second,
a perspective related to the vastness and variety of the objectives pursued through informal cooperation; third, one which focuses on the role of funding in support of this action; and lastly,
a perspective which examines the narrative framework of soft cooperation. This paper aims to assess whether and to what extent this trend reflects either a ‘more’ or ‘less’ law approach to third country
migration cooperation in the EU. Through the lens of European soft law theory, the status of informal cooperation within the realm of soft law is examined. As the choice of ‘more’ or ‘less’ law is inherently
political, the preference for alternative law-making methods can have an immense impact on the functioning of a legal system.
Thus, some of the practical consequences produced by soft law in this field are presented, namely de-proceduralisation, de-formalisation and de-legalisation.</p>

<p class="card-text">The recent, critical developments occurred after the Russian invasion of Ukraine have triggered serious repercussions on the whole international, economic and geo-political order. The effects seem especially impactful for the European and African regions,
with a number of potential, major consequences in humanitarian-migratory terms, as well as in crucial sectors such as energy, trade, food and agriculture. In this scenario, the Euro-African cooperation plays a pivotal role.
This contribution intends to focus on whether and to what extent the cooperation between the European and the African Unions may lead to a common, timely and effective response to current challenges such as agri-food security, climate change and migration.
It is divided into three main parts: the first is devoted to a general overview of the Africa-EU relations, and their different shapes and methodologies; the second focuses specifically on the bi-regional cooperation between the African Union and the European Union,
exploring its origin, subsequent evolution, as well as its legal- institutional settings; finally, the third part addresses the most recent initiatives put in place by the two international organizations with regard to issues such as food security, agriculture, climate change and environment.</p>

Following a brief reconstruction of the background of the Libyan crisis, the focus is put on the EU’s operational interventions in Libya,  with  the  analysis,  in  particular,  of  the  operations  EUBAM  Libya  and  EUNAVFOR  MED  “Operation Sophia”.
The multilateral response to the Libyan crisis put in place at the international level is  then  addressed,  focusing  on  the  collaboration  between  the  EU,  the  United  Nations and the African Union, with particular regard to the Joint Trilateral
Task force on migration and Libya established at the end of 2017. After analysing the concrete initiatives put in place by the AU-EU-UN Task Force to protect and evacuate migrants from Libyan detention centres, thearticle concludes by proposing an
overall assessment of the trilateral cooperation between these international organisations.</p>

<p class="card-text">This article will attempt to demonstrate the interrelationship between two ‘crises’ that the European Union is facing; the so-called ‘migration’ or ‘refugee crisis’ and the crisis of the
principle of the rule of law. In particular, the two crises find their point of connection in the responses to migratory flows put in place by the EU and some of its Member States.
The increasing migratory pressure on European external borders has induced some governments to adopt a restrictive and security-driven approach, carried out, on the one hand, by
reinforcing border controls and surveillance, and, on the other, by seeking the cooperation of non-EU countries in order to curb migratory flows, contain departures, and tackle the
movements of migrants towards Europe. These ‘securitisation’ and ‘externalisation’ strategies are in contrast with the principle of the rule of law under two perspectives: on the one hand,
they violate some of its essential components, such as transparency, legal and procedural certainty, democratic participation, and control; on the other, they breach the same principle insofar
as they lead to severe human rights violations. As for the first aspect, migration and border control policies have been put in place by frontline States through a growing proliferation of atypical,
informal, and non-transparent measures of migration governance, which, sounding ‘legal’ without actually being so, allow legislative, procedural and democratic frames to be avoided. Examples in this
sense may be identified in the so-called EU-Turkey Statement or in the informal, over-simplified cooperation arrangements concluded by some EU frontline Member States with African countries, as in
the case of Italy and Niger. As for the second aspect, the impact on the rule of (human rights) law of the response of some EU Member States to the migration crisis may be measured through the case
law of the European Court of Human Rights and, more specifically, by considering the decisions concerning the most severe violations of migrants’ rights, including those of the prohibitions of
refoulement and of collective expulsion, as well as cases of illegal detention and deprivation of liberty.</p>

not interlinked or communicating. It also implies a blurring between third-country nationals and criminal offenders, problematic in two respects. First, the risk of conflict between the decisions of the
criminal judge and those of the administrative judge is high, and such conflict undermines the transparency and coherence of the system. Second, in most situations both administrative review and judicial
review have non-suspensive effect and suffer from a lack of effectiveness.</p>

<p class="card-text">Through a variety of examples, an appraisal of EU third-country informal cooperation on migration is provided to show that a preference towards softer instruments of cooperation has emerged.
To illustrate the breadth and depth of such informal tools, four perspectives are adopted: first, a geographical one, which elucidates the reach of the EU action; second,
a perspective related to the vastness and variety of the objectives pursued through informal cooperation; third, one which focuses on the role of funding in support of this action; and lastly,
a perspective which examines the narrative framework of soft cooperation. This paper aims to assess whether and to what extent this trend reflects either a ‘more’ or ‘less’ law approach to third country
migration cooperation in the EU. Through the lens of European soft law theory, the status of informal cooperation within the realm of soft law is examined. As the choice of ‘more’ or ‘less’ law is inherently
political, the preference for alternative law-making methods can have an immense impact on the functioning of a legal system.
Thus, some of the practical consequences produced by soft law in this field are presented, namely de-proceduralisation, de-formalisation and de-legalisation.</p>

<p class="card-text">The recent, critical developments occurred after the Russian invasion of Ukraine have triggered serious repercussions on the whole international, economic and geo-political order. The effects seem especially impactful for the European and African regions,
with a number of potential, major consequences in humanitarian-migratory terms, as well as in crucial sectors such as energy, trade, food and agriculture. In this scenario, the Euro-African cooperation plays a pivotal role.
This contribution intends to focus on whether and to what extent the cooperation between the European and the African Unions may lead to a common, timely and effective response to current challenges such as agri-food security, climate change and migration.
It is divided into three main parts: the first is devoted to a general overview of the Africa-EU relations, and their different shapes and methodologies; the second focuses specifically on the bi-regional cooperation between the African Union and the European Union,
exploring its origin, subsequent evolution, as well as its legal- institutional settings; finally, the third part addresses the most recent initiatives put in place by the two international organizations with regard to issues such as food security, agriculture, climate change and environment.</p>

The multilateral response to the Libyan crisis put in place at the international level is  then  addressed,  focusing  on  the  collaboration  between  the  EU,  the  United  Nations and the African Union, with particular regard to the Joint Trilateral
Task force on migration and Libya established at the end of 2017. After analysing the concrete initiatives put in place by the AU-EU-UN Task Force to protect and evacuate migrants from Libyan detention centres, thearticle concludes by proposing an

<p class="card-text">This article will attempt to demonstrate the interrelationship between two ‘crises’ that the European Union is facing; the so-called ‘migration’ or ‘refugee crisis’ and the crisis of the
principle of the rule of law. In particular, the two crises find their point of connection in the responses to migratory flows put in place by the EU and some of its Member States.
The increasing migratory pressure on European external borders has induced some governments to adopt a restrictive and security-driven approach, carried out, on the one hand, by
reinforcing border controls and surveillance, and, on the other, by seeking the cooperation of non-EU countries in order to curb migratory flows, contain departures, and tackle the
movements of migrants towards Europe. These ‘securitisation’ and ‘externalisation’ strategies are in contrast with the principle of the rule of law under two perspectives: on the one hand,
they violate some of its essential components, such as transparency, legal and procedural certainty, democratic participation, and control; on the other, they breach the same principle insofar
as they lead to severe human rights violations. As for the first aspect, migration and border control policies have been put in place by frontline States through a growing proliferation of atypical,
informal, and non-transparent measures of migration governance, which, sounding ‘legal’ without actually being so, allow legislative, procedural and democratic frames to be avoided. Examples in this
sense may be identified in the so-called EU-Turkey Statement or in the informal, over-simplified cooperation arrangements concluded by some EU frontline Member States with African countries, as in
the case of Italy and Niger. As for the second aspect, the impact on the rule of (human rights) law of the response of some EU Member States to the migration crisis may be measured through the case
law of the European Court of Human Rights and, more specifically, by considering the decisions concerning the most severe violations of migrants’ rights, including those of the prohibitions of
refoulement and of collective expulsion, as well as cases of illegal detention and deprivation of liberty.</p>

not interlinked or communicating. It also implies a blurring between third-country nationals and criminal offenders, problematic in two respects. First, the risk of conflict between the decisions of the
criminal judge and those of the administrative judge is high, and such conflict undermines the transparency and coherence of the system. Second, in most situations both administrative review and judicial
review have non-suspensive effect and suffer from a lack of effectiveness.</p>
