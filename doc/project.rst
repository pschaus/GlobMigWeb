Project
+++++++++

The recent refugee crisis placed migration policy in the forefront of the global policy debate. 
World economy trends suggest that there may be further episodes of large-scale migration in the future. 
With the financial support of the ARC convention 18/23-091, GLOBMIG is a 48-month interdiscplinary project 
that aims at developing stronger conceptual tools to better understand and model global migration patterns, 
to anticipate future migration pressures, and to investigate the global implications of policy reforms.

Our Goals
------------

GLOBMIG has assembled a team of economists, demographers, lawyers, and computer scientists around three objectives: 

* to gain understanding of the long-run root drivers of international migration and of their complex interactions with the socio-demographic, climatic, institutional and economic environments

* to produce integrated projections of migration, population, and global inequality

* to use the knowledge base to assess the effectiveness and policy coherence of the legal framework

Despite considerable improvements in the recent literature, little is known about the root drivers of long-run trends in the size and structure of migration, 
about the interplay between internal and international migrations, or about the effects of policy reforms on migration flows and about their coherence with other policies. 
GLOBMIG aims at shedding light on these issues. It goes beyond the state of the art in combining traditional and innovative sources of data 
(e.g., big data on cell-phone owners’ mobility, worldwide opinion surveys on migration intentions, geo-referenced data on population changes, comparative data on immigration laws and 
policies), and in developing new methodologies for processing and analyzing them (e.g., data mining, machine learning, migration accounting models). 
The project is divided into two phases and six work packages. In the first “designing phase” of the project, general modelling tools will be developed, 
the inventory and assessment of migration laws and policies will be produced, and the exploratory analyses of innovative data sources will be conducted. 
In the second “operational phase” (24 months), we will produce specific knowledge on the links between international migration, internal migration, migration policies, 
demo-economic changes, climatic factors and conflicts.

The GLOBMIG Legal Component: An Inventory of European Law and Policies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The legal component of the GLOBMIG project consists of the development of an inventory of EU migration law and policy – accessible on this website and ready to use – 
that can enable research on the implications of legal and policy reforms at a European level. 
The inventory is coupled with an easy-to-read user’s guide, so as to clarify essential notions necessary to navigate the inventory and grasp its main findings.

**Background**

The inventory covers a period of approximately 40 years, from 1980 to 2021, and it is divided into the eight chronological phases. 
The most relevant legal and policy measures adopted within the European legal order with regard to migration – more than a thousand – 
have been included in the inventory, classified into categories and assessed in light of different criteria. 
The phases are not equal in length: they have been designed according to the major legal-institutional changes occurred at the EU level.

The inventory has been created by EDEM members Francesco Luigi Gatta and Eleonora Frasca under the supervision of Jean-Yves Carlier and Sylvie Sarolea within the context of the 48-month GLOBMIG project, 
funded by the University of Louvain (UCLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) within the actions de recherches concertées (ARC). 
The ambition of the project is to gather a wide array of measures in the field of migration law, to be then processed in quantitative terms by economists and demographers 
with the aim of investigating whether and how European legal and policy measures have an impact on migratory flows (and/or vice versa).

Beyond the general interdisciplinary objective of the GLOBMIG project in its entirety, the detailed GLOBMIG inventory is already, in itself, a tool that can be used for other legal research or publications, particularly by lawyers.
